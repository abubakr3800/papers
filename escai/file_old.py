# Abstract
doc.add_heading("Abstract", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This research expands on the eSCai smart street lighting system, emphasizing adaptive control of LED fixtures "
    "to reduce traffic accidents and optimize energy usage. The study identifies the problem of reduced visibility "
    "under rain and fog and the high cost of operating LEDs at full power. The proposed solution introduces adaptive "
    "dimming, correlated color temperature (CCT) adjustment, and smart control algorithms. Comparative analysis "
    "demonstrates that operating LEDs at 50% doubles lifespan and saves up to 50% energy while maintaining or "
    "enhancing visibility. The findings show significant improvements in safety and cost-effectiveness."

# Introduction
doc.add_heading("Introduction", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Road safety remains a major global challenge, particularly under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog. "
    "Traditional street lighting systems are static and do not adjust to changing environmental conditions. Operating LEDs "
    "continuously at 100% power shortens lifespan due to heat generation, while also leading to higher energy costs. "
    "This paper introduces eSCai, a smart adaptive street lighting fixture that addresses these issues."
)

# Problem Statement
doc.add_heading("Problem Statement", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Traffic accidents are common under fog and rain due to reduced visibility. Conventional lighting does not address "
    "this issue. At the same time, full-power LED operation increases energy consumption and reduces lifespan. "
    "The challenge: combine safety, efficiency, and sustainability."

# Why 3000K CCT
doc.add_heading("Why 3000K CCT Improves Visibility in Fog", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Fog consists of fine water droplets that scatter light. Shorter wavelengths (blue/white ~450nm, 6000K CCT) scatter more, "
    "causing glare. Longer wavelengths (yellowish ~600nm, 3000K CCT) scatter less, penetrating fog more effectively. "
    "Empirical evidence (Kang & Kwon, 2021, Applied Sciences) shows up to 300% improvement in contrast for dark targets in fog."
