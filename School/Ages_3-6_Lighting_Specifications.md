# LED Lighting Specifications for Ages 3-6: Library, Painting, and Playing Room

## Overview
This document provides detailed lighting specifications for educational spaces designed for children aged 3-6 years, specifically focusing on library, painting, and playing room environments. The specifications are based on research from "Impact of LED lighting on Age 3-6 while they are painting, Playroom and library in school" and related studies.

## 1. Library Lighting Specifications

### Color Temperature
- **Recommended Range**: 3000K - 4000K (Warm to Neutral White)
- **Optimal Value**: 3500K
- **Rationale**: Warm lighting creates a comfortable, inviting atmosphere for reading while maintaining good visual acuity

### CRI (Color Rendering Index)
- **Minimum Requirement**: 90+
- **Target Value**: 95+
- **Rationale**: High CRI ensures accurate color perception for picture books and educational materials

### Glare Control
- **UGR (Unified Glare Rating)**: ≤ 16
- **Implementation**:
  - Use indirect lighting fixtures
  - Install baffles or diffusers
  - Position fixtures to avoid direct eye contact
  - Use matte finishes on surfaces

### Uniformity
- **Minimum Uniformity Ratio**: 0.7
- **Target Uniformity Ratio**: 0.8
- **Illuminance Levels**:
  - General reading areas: 300-500 lux
  - Task areas (tables): 500-750 lux
  - Display areas: 400-600 lux

## 2. Painting Room Lighting Specifications

### Color Temperature
- **Recommended Range**: 5000K - 6500K (Cool White to Daylight)
- **Optimal Value**: 5500K
- **Rationale**: Cooler light enhances color perception and creativity while providing natural daylight-like conditions

### CRI (Color Rendering Index)
- **Minimum Requirement**: 95+
- **Target Value**: 98+
- **Rationale**: Maximum color accuracy is crucial for art activities and color learning

### Glare Control
- **UGR (Unified Glare Rating)**: ≤ 19
- **Implementation**:
  - Use adjustable task lighting
  - Install anti-glare diffusers
  - Ensure proper fixture positioning
  - Use non-reflective surfaces

### Uniformity
- **Minimum Uniformity Ratio**: 0.8
- **Target Uniformity Ratio**: 0.9
- **Illuminance Levels**:
  - General painting areas: 500-750 lux
  - Individual workstations: 750-1000 lux
  - Color mixing areas: 1000-1200 lux

## 3. Playing Room Lighting Specifications

### Color Temperature
- **Recommended Range**: 4000K - 5000K (Neutral to Cool White)
- **Optimal Value**: 4500K
- **Rationale**: Balanced lighting that supports both active play and quiet activities

### CRI (Color Rendering Index)
- **Minimum Requirement**: 90+
- **Target Value**: 93+
- **Rationale**: Good color rendering for toys and educational materials

### Glare Control
- **UGR (Unified Glare Rating)**: ≤ 22
- **Implementation**:
  - Use recessed lighting fixtures
  - Install wide-angle diffusers
  - Ensure even distribution
  - Use soft, indirect lighting

### Uniformity
- **Minimum Uniformity Ratio**: 0.7
- **Target Uniformity Ratio**: 0.8
- **Illuminance Levels**:
  - General play areas: 300-500 lux
  - Active play zones: 400-600 lux
  - Quiet corners: 250-400 lux

## 4. Additional Considerations

### Flicker Control
- **Frequency**: ≥ 20,000 Hz
- **Flicker Index**: ≤ 0.1
- **Rationale**: Eliminates potential negative effects on children's nervous system and visual comfort

### Energy Efficiency
- **Luminous Efficacy**: ≥ 100 lm/W
- **Power Factor**: ≥ 0.9
- **Dimmability**: 10-100% range recommended

### Safety Requirements
- **IP Rating**: IP20 for indoor use
- **Impact Resistance**: IK08 or higher
- **Temperature**: Surface temperature ≤ 60°C

### Maintenance
- **Lamp Life**: ≥ 50,000 hours
- **Maintenance Factor**: 0.8
- **Cleaning Schedule**: Quarterly recommended

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### Fixture Selection
- Choose LED fixtures with high CRI ratings
- Ensure proper beam angles for each application
- Select fixtures with appropriate IP ratings
- Consider dimming capabilities for flexibility

### Installation Requirements
- Follow manufacturer's installation guidelines
- Ensure proper spacing for uniformity
- Install emergency lighting systems
- Provide adequate access for maintenance

### Controls
- Implement daylight harvesting where possible
- Use occupancy sensors for energy efficiency
- Provide manual override capabilities
- Consider scene setting for different activities

## 6. Monitoring and Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
- Regular illuminance measurements
- CRI verification
- Glare assessment
- Uniformity calculations

### User Feedback
- Teacher observations
- Student comfort levels
- Activity performance correlation
- Visual comfort assessments
